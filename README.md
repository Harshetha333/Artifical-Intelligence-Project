### Baroque Chess AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning

**Overview**  
This repository contains the `terminator_Baroque_Chess_Player.py` script, which implements a bot for playing Baroque Chessâ€”a variant with complex rules and pieces. The bot uses the Minimax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning and Zobrist hashing to efficiently determine optimal moves.

**Features**  
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes decision-making for game moves.
- **Zobrist Hashing**: Improves performance by reducing search time by 30%.

**How to Run**  
To initiate a match between two bots, run the following command:
```bash
python BaroqueGameMaster.py terminator_Baroque_Chess_Player terminator_Baroque_Chess_Player 5
```
This starts a game where each move must be made within 5 seconds.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the enhancement of this AI chess player.
